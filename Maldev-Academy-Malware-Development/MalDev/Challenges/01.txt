BaseN Encoder - Entropy Reduction 
Throughout the Maldev Academy course it was demonstrated how entropy levels can lead to a malware getting caught by security solutions. This occurs because security solutions rely on entropy as one indicator of potential malicious activity. Therefore, when developing malware, it is generally advised to keep entropy levels low to avoid raising suspicion from security solutions.

One technique that be used to reduce entropy is through the use of Base32 encoding. The challenge for this week is to review the article below, understand how Base32 encoding can be used to reduce entropy and build a working program that encodes a given payload.
