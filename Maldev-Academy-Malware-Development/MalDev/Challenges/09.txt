 Shellcoding: Stager & Local Inject 
Attempt to create a concise shellcode binary that establishes a connection with a custom HTTP server that's hosting a payload at a designated endpoint and port. This can occur either through HTTPS via WinHTTP/WinInet or via TCP using WinSock2. After retrieving the shellcode, inject this payload into the current process using module stomping.

This task builds upon the prior challenge, which focuses on crafting fundamental shellcode in C/C++ and assembly. If you lack experience in shellcoding with C/C++ and assembly, it's strongly recommend attempting earlier shellcode challenges first.
