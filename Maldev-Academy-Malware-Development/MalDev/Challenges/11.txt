 Stage & Early Bird Injection 
For this week's challenge, we'll explore creating a stager that fetches shellcode from a remote location and then uses the early bird injection technique to inject the payload into a process.
This challenge will have overlapping concepts that were shown in "Module 30: Payload Staging - Web Server" and "Module 40: Early Bird APC Injection".

Bonus: The code for this challenge fetches the payload via HTTP. Modify the code to retrieve the payload via HTTPS instead.
