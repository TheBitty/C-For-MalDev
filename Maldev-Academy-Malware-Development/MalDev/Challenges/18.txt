 TLS & Fibers For Shellcode Execution 
In this week's challenge, we will explore the integration of two techniques to execute our shellcode within the current process context. We will leverage TLS and Fibers, which were introduced in recent modules, to run a basic calc.exe payload shellcode generated through msfvenom. This challenge will cover concepts that have been previously covered in Module 34: Payload Staging - Web Server and the new Module 33: Utilizing Fibers for Payload Execution.
