 Custom GetProcAddress: Compile-Time Hash Obfuscation 
In this week's challenge, our objective is to utilize constexpr for compile-time hashing with obfuscation. This will result in a dynamically changing hash value each time the string undergoes compilation, and we will integrate this approach into our custom GetProcAddress function.

It is advisable to have completed the previous challenges of compile-time obfuscation challenges before attempting this one, as it builds upon those concepts.

This challenge will contain concepts previously introduced in Module 57: IAT Hiding & Obfuscation - Compile Time API Hashing.
