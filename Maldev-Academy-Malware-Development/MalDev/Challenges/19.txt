 Inserting a Custom Section Into a PE
In this week's challenge, we will be taking a look at inserting custom sections into already compiled PEs. This capability can prove extremely valuable, especially when developing a modular loader that retrieves shellcode or payloads from its own file. It accomplishes this by iterating over its sections and locating the specific section containing the configuration or payload, which it then loads and executes by name.

This challenge will encompass concepts that were previously introduced in Module 8: Portable Executable Format and Module 50: Parsing PE Headers.
