 Manually Mapping API Set Names 
In the API Set Resolution challenge, we touched upon a Windows feature known as API Set Resolution.

For this week's challenge, the objective is to resolve specific modules based on API Set Resolution names and subsequently either allocate them into memory using methods like NtMapViewOfSection or employ alternative custom module mapping techniques (manual mapping) or even utilize LoadLibrary. 

It's highly recommended to have completed the API Set Resolution challenge before trying this one. Additionally, this challenge integrates with previously acquired knowledge, drawing connections with earlier lessons on mapping modules from Module 42 and Module 85.
