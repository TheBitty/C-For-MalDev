 Generating Encryption Keys Without WinAPI Calls
In this week's challenge, we will examine the process of generating encryption keys without making any calls to system APIs, such as CryptGenRandom, BCryptGenRandom, RtlRandomEx, and so forth. This can be accomplished by utilizing an intrinsic function known as RDRAND. You can invoke RDRAND in C/C++ by importing the immintrin.h library and employing it through functions named _rdrand16_step, _rdrand32_step, and _rdrand64_step.

Use SystemFunction032 encryption algorithm with the generated keys to encrypt the provided data or string: "5pider was here. yolo".

This challenge contains overlapping concepts that were shown in Module 18: Payload Encryption - RC4
