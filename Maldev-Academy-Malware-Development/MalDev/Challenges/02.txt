 Forwarded Functions 
In Module 53, IAT Hiding & Obfuscation - Custom GetProcAddress, it was shown how to write your own custom GetProcAddress function which resolves a function address based on a loaded module's address and function name string. 

Although this module covers writing a reliable and well-implemented GetProcAddress function, there is a crucial missing feature which is very common in Windows when it comes to resolving a function. The implemented GetProcAddress does not support "forwarded functions". 

Forwarded functions are exported function which are not truly implemented in the specified DLL and instead are simply forwarding to another DLL and function.

If you have already completed Module 53 then you can try to solve this challenge by implementing forwarded function support into your custom GetProcAddress implementation. I have listed resources relating to Forwarded Functions to help you and guide you.
