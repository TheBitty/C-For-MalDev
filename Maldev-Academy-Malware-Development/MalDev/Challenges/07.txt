 Malware Kill Date 
As part of an anti-debugging measure, it's possible to include a kill date to your malware whereby the malware will not execute after a specified date.

This challenge requires you to implement a kill date to your malware. If the malware is being executed after a chosen date, terminate the process and self-delete the binary from disk.

Hint: This challenge will have overlapping concepts that were shown in module 72 (Anti-Debugging - Self-deletion) and the new module 21 (Building a DRM-Equipped Malware).
