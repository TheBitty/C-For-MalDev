 API Set Resolution 
API Set resolution is a DLL redirection mechanism that Microsoft introduced in Windows 7 and Windows 8. API Set DLL files generally have the naming format of api-*.dll or ext-*.dll. These DLL files are simply a virtual alias for a physical DLL file. It's an implementation-hiding technique, where you as the caller don't have to know exactly which module is hosting the information.

For example, api-ms-win-crt-locale-11-1-0.dll is an API Set and its alias is ucrtbase.dll.

The Process Environment Block (PEB) contains a member called ApiSetMap that is of type PAPI_SET_NAMESPACE. This is essentially a hash table containing a namespace of names and values that holds the name of the API Set and the alias where it was redirecting to.

LoadLibrary handles and loads the right module from disk based on the API Set's virtual alias. Whereas, in a custom implementation of LoadLibrary, one would need to manually implement this functionality. Essentially, it's a small edge case that can be handled in a custom LoadLibrary implementation in order to support more modules.

The challenge is to try to parse the PEB.ApiSetMap member namespace and resolve following API Sets:
- api-ms-win-base-util-l1-1-0.dll
- api-ms-win-core-com-l1-1-3.dll
- api-ms-win-core-crt-l1-1-0.dll
- api-ms-win-ole32-ie-l1-1-0.dll
